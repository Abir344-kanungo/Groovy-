## 🧠 OOP Design Overview

| Class         | Responsibility                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Main`        | Launches the application                                            |
| `GroovyFrame` | Handles all UI components (text area, input field, buttons)         |
| `GroovyBot`   | Contains the logic for processing user input and generating replies |

### ✅ Key OOP Concepts

* **Encapsulation**: Each class has a clearly defined responsibility
* **Abstraction**: UI logic separated from chatbot logic
* **Polymorphism**: Easily extensible for future AI enhancements
* **Modularity**: Maintains clean code separation for GUI and backend logic
